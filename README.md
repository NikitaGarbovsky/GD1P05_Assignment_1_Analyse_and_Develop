## Gameplay

Gameplay consists of positioning the player controlled ship to positions horizontally on the screen, shooting projectiles and destroying a variety of different types of "drone" ships. 

When the player destroys a rectangular reflective drone with their empowered square attack, the rectangle attaches itself to the player ship, and increases its firepower throughput. 

The players win condition is destroying the 4 large red barriers once acquiring all 5 orbs and 4 rectangles, empowering the players attack.
