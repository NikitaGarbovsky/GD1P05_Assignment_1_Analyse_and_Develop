## Drone Invaders is a twist on the classic arcade game space invaders.

This project was the first Assessment assigned to students within the Gameplay Programming GD1P05 Paper for the first Semester at Media Design School.

## Gameplay

Gameplay consists of positioning the player controlled ship to positions horizontally on the screen, shooting projectiles and destroying a variety of different types of "drone" ships. 

When the player destroys a rectangular reflective drone with their empowered square attack, the rectangle attaches itself to the player ship, and increases its firepower throughput. 

The players win condition is destroying the 4 large red barriers once acquiring all 5 orbs and 4 rectangles, empowering the players attack.
